*Welcome!*
This bot is designed to protect your chat.

Installation:

Add the bot to the chat and grant administrator rights.

*Workflow:*

When a new participant enters, a welcome message is displayed, asking the user to press the "I am human" button within 30 seconds.
When the "I am a spammer" button is pressed, the user is banned for 10 hours.
If the user does not press the button, they are banned for 10 minutes.
The message about the participant's entry into the chat is deleted.

*List of available commands:*

`/healthz` - ping, checking the availability of the bot (only works in private messages with the bot).

`/captcha` - enable/disable captcha when joining the chat.

`/attack` - activate/deactivate attack mode.

In attack mode, all new chat participants receive a temporary ban for 5 minutes. This command is useful during a mass invasion of spammers into the chat.
